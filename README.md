# ML-and-IoT-based-Self-Driving-car
ML and IoT based Self Driving car; Using AlexNet, Tensorflow, NRF, Python Source code, totally on open source.
Project originally run on computer with CUDA enabled NVIDIA GPU (940MX GDDR5) with a Quad core CPU (i8-8250U), resulted in system usage of 90% (both CPU + GPU)
Coded on Python 3.5, executed in Python default IDE.
Dataset training and AlexNet CNN algoritm is modified to optimise the load for 2GB VRAM GPU.
Tensorflow 1.0 initial release if using source code as it is.
Tensorflow 2.0 release compability is issue and need to update certain functions
